# FdF

This project is about representing a landscape as a 3D object in which all surfaces are outlined in lines.

The representation in 3D of a landscape is a critical aspect of modern mapping. For example, in these times of spatial exploration, to have a 3D representation of Mars is a prerequisite condition to its conquest.
As another example, comparing various 3D representations of an area of high tectonic activity will allow you to better understand these phenomena and their evolution, and as a result, be better prepared.

FDF is short for ’fil de fer’ in French which means ’wireframe model’.

Executing fdf program: after make command, use: ./fdf test_maps/42.fdf (or any other map file from folder).

You can use this keys: ESC, W, A, S, D, and arrow keys.
